NeuralPy is a web-based application powered by a fine-tuned TinyLLaMA model that generates Python code from natural language queries and vice versa. The lightweight model is optimized for efficiency, enabling real-time code generation directly in the browser or on resource-constrained systems. NeuralPy serves as an intelligent coding assistant, ideal for learners, developers, and educators.

## Tech Stack
- ` Python ` : versatile, high-level, interpreted, easy-to-learn programming language.
- ` Scikit-Learn `: A powerful Python library for machine learning.
- ` Next.js ` : Frontend framework based on React for building dynamic, SSR-enabled interfaces.
- ` Flask `: A lightweight Python web framework to build APIs.
- `Tailwind-CSS` : A utility-first CSS framework for building custom, responsive designs quickly by composing classes directly in HTML.
- `Keras` : A high-level deep learning API running on top of TensorFlow, used to quickly build and train neural networks with minimal code.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahul-shrivastav/NeuralPy.git
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
Change the directory and Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
cd NeuralPy/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables in Frontend folder

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file in frontend
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
A sample .evn file is also provided in the repository.


### 4. Run the application locally

Navigate to `/backend` and run the development backend server :

```bash
python app.py
```
Now navigate to `/frontend` and run the development frontend server :
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open port `3000` on `localhost` with your browser to see the result.
