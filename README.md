NeuralPy is a web-based application powered by a fine-tuned TinyLLaMA model that generates Python code from natural language queries and vice versa. The lightweight model is optimized for efficiency, enabling real-time code generation directly in the browser or on resource-constrained systems. NeuralPy serves as an intelligent coding assistant, ideal for learners, developers, and educators.

## Tech Stack
- ` Python ` : versatile, high-level, interpreted, easy-to-learn programming language.
- ` Next.js ` : Frontend framework based on React for building dynamic, SSR-enabled interfaces.
- `Tailwind-CSS` : A utility-first CSS framework for building custom, responsive designs quickly by composing classes directly in HTML.
- `Pytorch` : A high-level deep learning API running on top of TensorFlow, used to quickly build and train neural networks with minimal code.

## Getting Started

</div>

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahul-shrivastav/NeuralPy.git
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
Change the directory and Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```
### 4. Run the application locally

Now navigate to `/frontend` and run the development frontend server :
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open port `3000` on `localhost` with your browser to see the result.

## Fine-Tuning Highlights

</div>

### Key Libraries & Tools
- ` Transformers, PEFT, BitsAndBytes, TRL (SFTTrainer) ` : orchestrate fine-tuning with quantized models and LoRA adapters.
- ` Pandas, Datasets ` : for dataset prep and handling.
- `Google Colab & Drive` : easy data access and training in the cloud.

### Techniques at a Glance

- 4-Bit Quantization with BitsAndBytes (NF4, double-quantization) lowers VRAM usage drastically—enabling efficient fine-tuning even on modest hardware. 
- LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) injects lightweight adapter modules into frozen base layers, maintaining performance while tuning significantly fewer parameters. 
- QLoRA-style setup — combining quantization and LoRA for maximal efficiency without loss in effectiveness. 
- Trainer : TRL’s SFTTrainer orchestrates training with PEFT integration, using optimizer “paged_adamw_32bit”, cosine learning rate schedule, and gradient accumulation.

### Workflow Summary

- Data prep : Convert CSV with instruction + output columns into conversational tokens using <|user|> / <|assistant|> delimiters.
- Load model : 'TinyLlama-1.1B…' in highly-efficient 4-bit mode.
- Configure LoRA : Rank = 8, alpha = 16, dropout = 0.05, task type = CAUSAL_LM.
- Train : With FP16, batch size 1, gradient accumulation, 250 steps (max), and mixed-precision.
- Merge adapters : merge_and_unload() integrates LoRA weights back into the base model for faster, dependency-free inference.
